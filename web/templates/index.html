        <h3>Register a Pet</h3>
        <p>Pet registration allows you to register your pet to our system. In the event that 
            one of your pets goes missing you will have to fill out a form to report the pet as missing 
            but with pet registration you will be able to register your pet in advance and if you 
            ever need to make a missing report, you can do so in the click of a button.
